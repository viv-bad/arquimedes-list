# To do:

- Persist all data in API (json server for now, then mongodb in future)
- mongodb?
- styling - pure css or tailwind?
- use context/provider to pass data?
- Persist khadija/vivek tag in mongodb - (khadija = false, vivek = true)
- drag to reorder (grid)
- Fix bug for checked off items, when you reload page you need to click twice to uncheck
- Add - completed on (DATE) when checkbox is completed
